This is a Blood Bank Management System in C++. it helps manage and streamline the processes within a blood bank. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create classes for donors, hospitals, and blood packets. Key features include donor registration, blood donation tracking, compatibility checks (matching blood types), and managing inventory levels. The system may also include authentication for secure access, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions. This system improves the efficiency of managing blood donations, storage, and distribution to hospitals.
